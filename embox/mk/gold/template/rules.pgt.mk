##PARAMETERS
# Rule productions for '%Name%' grammar.
##END-PARAMETERS

#
# As for symbols each rule can have a constructor that is used to produce an
# application-specific representation of the rule data.
# Production functions are named '$(gold_grammar)_produce-<ID>' and have the
# following signature:
#
# Params:
#   1..N: Each argument contains a value of the corresponding symbol in the RHS
#         of the rule production.
#
# Return:
#   The value to pass as an argument to a rule containing the production
#   of this rule in its RHS, or to return to user in case of the Start Symbol.
#
# If production function is not defined then the rule is produced by
# concatenating the RHS through spaces. To reuse this default value one can
# call 'gold_default_produce' function.
#

##RULES
# Rule: %Description%
# Args: 1..%SymbolCount% - Symbols in the RHS.
define $(gold_grammar)_produce-%ID%
