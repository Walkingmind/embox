#
# Usage:
#
# Part of root Makefile using traverse may look like:
##
#   include $(MK_DIR)/traverse.mk
#
#   # Guard symbol used in subdirs.
#   _ = traversed/$(abspath $(dir))/
#
#   # Traverse always defines SELFDIR before entering sub-makefile.
#   dir = $(SELFDIR)
#   DIRS := $(call traverse,$(SRC_DIR),node.mk)
#
#   # Get list of all objects.
#   OBJS := $(foreach dir,$(DIRS),$(wildcard $($_OBJS:%=$(dir)/%)))
#
#   all: $(TARGET)
#   $(TARGET): $(OBJS)
#   	@$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^
##
#
# node.mk files placed in each sub-directory should contain something like:
##
#   $_OBJS += irq.o
#   $_OBJS += main.o
#   $_OBJS += init.o
##
# Each time before node.mk is included variable SELFDIR is set to location of
# node.mk being processed. Guard symbol ($_) is used to prevent namespace
# collisions, and it also helps to determine where did a variable come from.
#
# By default traverse searches the whole directory tree, but this behavior can
# be overridden by setting SUBDIRS variable in any node.mk file, e.g.:
#   SUBDIRS := $(filter-out include,$(SUBDIRS))
# This expression will exclude sub-directory named "include" from searching.
#
# Enjoy!
#

#
# Walks the directory tree starting at the specified root,
# processing node descriptors with given file name.
#
# Params:
#  1. Root directory
#  2. (optional) File name of node descriptor containing info about subdirs
#   If not specified traverse will search for files named Makefile and makefile
