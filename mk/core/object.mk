ifndef __core_object_mk
__core_object_mk := 1

##
# Usage example:
#
##
#  include core/object.mk
#
#  define class foo
#
#    ##
#    # This is a field. Every instance of class has its own field value.
#    #
#    # There also can be a default value which is assigned to the field at the
#    # time of object creation. The default value is expanded each time a new
#    # object is constructed, and the expansion result is then assigned to the
#    # object's field. Expansion context is much like the constructor call
#    #
#    # Fields are denoted with $. prefix.
#    #
#    $.bar = Default value
#
#    # Fields can be defined verbatim
#    define $.baz
#      Multi-line value, \
#       where $0 expands to 'foo', and $1 - to this - a pointer to the object being constructed
#
#    # This is the constructor.
#    # Fields are denoted with $. prefix.
#    $,foo = Default value, where $0 expands to 'foo', and $1 - to this
