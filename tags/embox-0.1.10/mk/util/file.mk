# Extended version of wildcard that understands double asterisk pattern (**).
#
# Usage: $(call r-wildcard,pattern)
#
# NOTE: does not handle properly more than one ** tokens.

# Directory/file versions of wildcard.
# Both of them are based on the fact that wildcard expansion of the expression
# containing the trailing slash drops the slash for files but leaves it for
# directories.

##
# Directory-only wildcard. This version of wildcard filters out any files
# leaving only directories.
#
# Usage: $(call d-wildcard,pattern)
#
d-wildcard = $(patsubst %/,%,$(filter %/,$(wildcard $(1:%=%/))))

##
# File-only wildcard. This version of wildcard leaves only files in the
# expansion result.
#
# Usage: $(call f-wildcard,pattern)
#
f-wildcard = $(patsubst %/,%,$(filter-out %/,$(wildcard $(1:%=%/))))

# Params:
#  1. Base directory
#  2. Subdirectories list relative to the base dir possibly containing wildcard
#     expressions.
#
# In a nutshell:
#   Expand d-wildcards for sub-dirs within the base dir.
#   Get back to sub-dirs relative names and remove duplicates.
