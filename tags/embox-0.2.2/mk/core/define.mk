define __def_expand
	# It is essential to use simple variable definition here to allow
	# redifinitions inside the expansion.
	#
	# The reason of this limitation is a bug in expansion engine of
	# GNU Make which affects all recent versions that implement 'eval'
	# function (any of 3.8x).
	#
	# The simplest case that reproduces this bug is expanding recursive
	# variable 'foo' defined as follows:
	#
	#   foo = $(eval foo =)
	#
	# In that case steps that Make performs to expand string $(foo) are:
	#   1. Start expanding a reference to a recursive variable 'foo':
	#        $(foo)
	#   2. Get its value and start parsing it:
	#        $(eval foo =)
	#   3. Find an invocation of builtin function 'eval' and run it:
	#        foo =
	#   4. Redefine the variable 'foo' which is being expanded right now.
	#      Redefinition of an already defined variable also involves
	#      freeing a memory occupied by an old value.
	#   5. Return from builtin function handler back to string expansion
	#      code (see step 2).
	#   6. At this point the string being parsed refers to a memory block
	#      that has been freed in step 4.
	#
	# Symptoms that one can observe may vary depending on the actual value
	# of an expanding variable. These may include:
	#   - 'missing separator' error,
	#   - 'unterminated variable reference' and 'unterminated call to function'
	#      errors,
	#   - garbage in results in case if expansion succeeds.
	# The latter is clearly seen when running Make under Valgrind with
	# --free-fill flag.
	#
	# A possible workaround is to use simple variable assignments, like:
	#
	#   foo := $(eval foo =)
	#
	# Here expansion of the value being assigned occurs immediately before
	# actually assigning it and no redefinitions of recursive variables is
	# performed.
	#
	# The most significant drawback is that we can't use 'define' directive
	# in version 3.81 and lower because such variable would be defined
	# recursive. This forces us to escape newlines and comment hashes
	# properly.

# Here goes builtin functions transformation stuff.
#
# This part of logic is probably the most tricky and complicated.
# The processing is performed in two phases: inner and outer. Each phase
# involves some code transformation (namely installation of so-called hooks)
# with subsequent expansion of the code which fires the installed hooks.
#
# Inner phase is focused on structural checks of code. Depending on what it
# does recognize (variable expansion, substitution reference, function
# call, etc.) it installs necessary hooks for the outer phase.
#
# Outer phase manages a so-called expansion stack which is used to track how
# the expansion is actually performed by Make. It also helps to collect
# arguments passed to functions occurred in the code. Unlike inner the outer
# phase performs high-level code checks and transformations which include
# checking number of arguments passed to a certain function, defining extended
# builtin functions and so on.
#
# In order to prevent execution of the code being processed all dollar signs
# are quadruplicated ($ -> $$$$). After both expansions have been performed
# dollars are automatically restored to the initial state ($$$$ -> $$ -> $).

# Tries to substitute the builtin by an inlined call to a user-defined

#
# In case when inlining of some arguments might lead to possible
# side effects (namely when an argument contains a call to any function or
# references a variable which is not proven to be simply expanded, and that
# argument is used in the target function more than once or is not used at all)
# then this routine falls back to using regular function call.
#
# It is important to notice that only a static textual substitution of formal
# argument references is performed.
#
# This routine does NOT recognize:
#   - computed variable references:
#       foo = $(foreach a,1 2 3,$($a)) # error
#
#   - substitution references within arguments:
#       foo = $(1:bar=baz) # error
#
#   - getting the value of an argument using 'value' and 'call' functions:
#       foo = $(call 1) $(value 2) # error
#
#   - referencing an argument within a macro expansion of some other
#     recursive variable:
#       foo = $(bar) # error
#       bar = $1
#
# You must NOT try to inline such functions: the call would be inlined
# improperly with no errors/warnings reported.
#
# Return:
#   The code transormed to a function call (may be inlined).
#
# Example:
#   Builtin function 'eq' is marked to be inlineable and the corresponding
#   function is defined as follows:
#     eq = $(findstring $1,$(findstring $2,$1))
#
#   As you can see, the first argument is used twice. Thus in some cases the
#   function call can't be inlined.
#
#     $(eq foo,bar)     # OK, no expansion references at all.
#                       # $(findstring foo,$(findstring bar,foo))
#
#     $(eq foo,$(bar))  # OK, $(bar) is used only once inside 'eq'.
#                       # $(findstring foo,$(findstring $(bar),foo))
#
#     $(eq $3,bar)      # OK, $3 is automatic variable and it is always simple.
#                       # $(findstring $3,$(findstring bar,$3))
#
#     $(eq $(foo),bar)  # Failure, $(foo) would be expanded twice.
#                       # Using regular call:
#                       # $(call eq,$(foo),bar)
#
# Note:
#   Inlining may break the order of arguments expansion. Preserving the right
#   order is a responsibility of the target function being inlined.
