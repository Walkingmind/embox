Embox can be executed on several processor architectures. There are a simulator for each of them. And you can debug you code without hardware platform.
The main simulator is QEMU.
Details for simulation on different processor architecture below:
  * [Simulation on x86 platform simulators](SimulationX86.md)
  * [Simulation on a SPARC v8 Leon3 processor](SimulationSparc.md)
  * [Simulation on an ARM](SimulationARM.md)
