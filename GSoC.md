# Google Summer of Code #

Every summer, Google sponsors a [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) global program in which students are paid for work on open source projects.

Embox Project applies to participate in GSoC (this year is our second attempt).
Our primary goal is to expand the developers community, improve the existing code base and add some new features.

## About us ##
Embox is a small fine-tuned real-time operating system. Because of it having modular architecture it suits well for resources limited and embedded systems.
A small codebase and a clear structure allows to understand both global architecture and different parts of systemâ€™s algorithms (scheduler, network, file system and so on).
As Embox is built to be real-time system it allows to apply it in robotic systems (for example, car remote control).

## Current year ##
Google has announced the [GSoC 2012](http://www.google-melange.com/) program. This year we present three ideas, you can find them at the following link:
