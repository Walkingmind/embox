Embox can be executed on several processor architectures. There are a simulator for each of them. And you can debug you code without hardware platform.
The main simulator is QEMU.
Details for simulation on different processor architecture below:
 * [SimulationX86 Simulation on x86 platform simulators]
 * [SimulationSparc Simulation on a SPARC v8 Leon3 processor]
 * [SimulationARM Simulation on an ARM]
