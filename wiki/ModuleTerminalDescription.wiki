#summary This page describes our vision of the terminal

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

The terminal is a server which allows serial input/output through a hardware device driver. It looks like as tty devices in *NIX* systems. A process/thread can request a terminal during creation.

We separate three levels of the terminal:
|| shell   || command interpreter ||
|| console || tty driver || 
|| port    || device driver ||

= Features =
 # We can setup different device drivers
 # We can setup different command interpreters
 # We can setup different mode of console (VT102, VT100...)
 # We can setup different mode of console (Raw, CANONICAL)
 # We can use very simple console (the only output) or statically linked part of terminal

= Roadmap =
The first of our terminal was described [RuIOShell here].

Started milestone 0.1.8 we decided rework this subsystem duided by the requirements of the Features. First of all we made up our mind to implement [RuShellTalking simple terminal]
