#summary Cygwin installation HOWTO.

As far as Embox uses GNU toolchain, you'll need to setup a Unix-like environment
on you Windows machine.
We recommend you to use *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin Cygwin]* for that
purpose.

= Brief =

If you are familiar with Cygwin installation procedure, you can skip the most of
this guide. You should install the following packages:
 * *make* 3.81 or above
 * *gcc* or *gcc4* of any stable version
Do not forget to add Cygwin's *`bin`* directory to your *PATH*.

= Step-by-step =
== Download ==

Go to *[http://cygwin.com]* and download Cygwin setup executable.

  Click on _Install or update Cygwin now!_

== Install ==

Run the setup executable and proceed through installation steps.

=== Installation type ===

Keep the default value:
 * *Install from Internet*

=== Installation directory ===

When prompted, choose the Cygwin installation directory. The default is
*`C:\cygwin`*, but you can change it. Leave *Install for* as default:
 * *All Users*
*Note* that the directory path *must not* contain any spaces or non-latin characters.

=== Local Package directory ===

Cygwin will download its installation files to the specified directory. The
default is directory which was used to save the setup executable. You may leave
the default value.

=== Connection type ===

Setup your Internet connection which will be used to download installation
files. The right choice depends on your ISP and network settings.

=== Download sites ===

Choose any available mirror.

=== Select Packages ===

Default Cygwin installation includes only minimal subset of all available
packages.

We also need GNU *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software) make]*
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation build automation] tool and
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection gcc]* for the host
platform.

==== make ====

Select package *make*, version *3.81* or higher.
 http://embox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/InstallToolchainWindowsCygwin/cygwin-setup-make.png
  Type `make` into search field and select _make_ from category _Devel_.

==== make troubleshooting ====
See https://code.google.com/p/embox/issues/detail?id=504

==== gcc ====

You are free to choose between *gcc* and *gcc4* packages of any stable version.
 http://embox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/InstallToolchainWindowsCygwin/cygwin-setup-gcc4.png
  Search for `gcc` and select _gcc_ or _gcc4_ from category _Devel_.

=== Finish the Installation ===

You'll be notified about the packages to be installed and prompted whether to
create desktop icons after the installation is complete.

== Setup the PATH ==

To invoke Cygwin applications outside Cygwin Bash Console (e.g. from
[InstallToolchainEclipse Eclipse]) you should also add
*_[#Installation_directory <Cygwin root>]_\bin* to the
[InstallToolchainPath#Windows PATH environment variable].

For example, you can create new user variable `PATH` (or modify existing, if
any) with value `%PATH%;C:\cygwin\bin`.
