#summary Olimex flashing & debuging with JTAG
= Setup =

Assuming you have Olimex SAM7 series board with JTAG interface adapter. You can run and test Embox after few quite simple steps. Please, read it all before doing anything.

 * Get OpenOCD, free suite for On-Chip debuging. Source can be grabbed [http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4148&release_id=17280 here], compiled version can be downloaded from 
  * [http://www.freddiechopin.info/index.php/en/download/category/4-openocd here], if you are on Windows 
  * or preferably from your repositary, if you are on Linux box
 * Install OpenOCD in your preferable path, it can be added into the $PATH or %PATH% for convenience
 * On Windows download and install [http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/ libusb]
 * Only now you should connect JTAG and board, plug JTAG in PC, then drain power to board
 * OpenOCD have predefined configs for boards and interfaces. You should combine boards/olimex_sam7_ex256 with one in interfaces, that suite your JTAG adapter, in openocd.conf. Or you can use predefined [http://embox.googlecode.com/files/openocd.cfg one]
 * In command line run 
{{{
openocd openocd.conf
}}}
 * Now you have gdb-server compatible environment on your local machine on tcp port 3333. You can simply load firmware like
{{{
gdb build/base/bin/embox # provide elf file
(gdb) target remote-extended :3333
(gdb) load
(gdb) continue
}}}
or use Eclipse for doing that
