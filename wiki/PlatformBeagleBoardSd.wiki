This page describes image building process that will boot embox on BeagleBoard.
If you want to run on real hardware, refer SD section. If you are looking for simulator, refer to QEMU.

= Boot SD =

Step-by-step 
 * Build embox with arm/omap template
 * Create uImage with scripts/omap-uboot-uimage like so
{{{
  user:~/embox$ ./scripts/omap-uboot-uimage
}}}
This will place `uImage` to embox root.
 * Create SD with [http://embox.googlecode.com/files/embox-omap-sd.tar.gz this]  script like so 
{{{
  user:~/embox$ /path/to/embox-omap-sd/create-boot-sd /dev/sdb ./uImage
}}}
WARNING!!! It will destroy all /dev/sdb content! Make sure device argument points to SD card, that you want overwrite.

Now you have bootable SD, plug it BeagleBoard and power it on.

= QEMU =

BeagleBoard is supported in QEMU with Linaro patched. Get it from [https://launchpad.net/qemu-linaro]

To just run embox on qemu choose creating nand image. If you want to test bootable sd before putting it in BeagleBoard, there is SD subsection.

== NAND image ==
Nand image creating is a bit complicated. So we've prepared scripts to build it and run qemu with apropriate options. Simply type

{{{
  user:~/embox$ ./scripts/qemu/auto_qemu
}}}

== SD card ==
Assuming you have prepared boot SD as descibed above, type

{{{
qemu-system-arm -M beagle -sd /dev/sdb -serial stdio
}}}
