*Embox* has base level architecture.

http://embox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/EmboxArchitecture/arch.png

The lowest level as a hardware abstraction layer ([Hal HAL]). The next is [Kernel kernel] level, usually It supports resources allocation and internal communication. The next is driver and [Services services] level, And the highest is [Applications applications] level.

= HAL =
[Hal this intesface] supports following platform specific operations and utilities as virtual memory primitives, atomic operations
clock sources and etc.
It is this interface implementation that need to porting Embox to a new architecture.

= Kernel =
[Kernel Kernel] provides time scheduling, protection address space, IPC and so on.

= Drivers =
[Drivers Drivers] provide unify program interface to hardware devices and program pseudo-devices. In this point of view this interface is simular as [Hal HAL] but HAL supports internal CPU features instead of drivers do external device.

= Services =

= Applications =
