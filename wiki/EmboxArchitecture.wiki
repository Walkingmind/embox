*Embox* has base level architecture.

= Kernel =
The type of Embox kernel architecture - exokernel. Kernel includes the following parts:
 * Threads
 * Tasks
 * Timers and clock source management
 * Hardware and software interrupts handling

Kernel properties:
 * Data Separation
 * Damage Limitation
 * Timesharing the processor between the partitions(threads, tasks or event handlers)
