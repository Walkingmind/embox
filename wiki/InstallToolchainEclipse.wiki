#summary Eclipse IDE installation HOWTO.

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Introduction =
embox is "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment IDE]-independent" project, so you can edit sources in your favorite editor, compiling them and invoking debugger directly from console. But those who prefer all-in-one solutions will probably look for some kind of integrated development environment.

We recommend you to use *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software) Eclipse IDE]*, especially since embox already contains the necessary project files.

Eclipse is cross-platform IDE, and its installation procedure is similar for both Windows and Linux systems.

= Brief =
If you have used Eclipse before, you can skip this guide. All you need is *Eclipse IDE* with *CDT* plugin and one of SVN client plugins (*Subversion* or *Subversive*).

The one thing to mention is the use of older versions of Eclipse or CDT (for example, if you already have one installed). CDT is a relatively young project, and therefore it is growing rapidly. So it is desirable to use the version at least not older than one year.

= Step-by-step =
== Download ==
Go to *[http://eclipse.org/downloads]* and select *Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers*.

  Be sure to choose the right version accordingly to your operating system.

== Install ==
All you do is unpack the downloaded file in the desired directory. The zip file contains single directory called `eclipse`, with multiple subdirectories under that. So you could unpack the zip file in the root directory (e.g., *`C:\`*) and Eclipse would be installed in *C:\eclipse*.

Run the *eclipse* executable from the installation directory.

= Known issues =
These steps will likely not be required. But if you have some problems running Eclipse, read below.

== Missing JRE ==
If you get *VM*-related errors when launching Eclipse, then you have to install the latest [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Runtime_Environment JRE].

=== Install on Windows ===
Go to *[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/]* and click _Download JRE_.

Then select you platform (*Windows* or *Windows x64*), agree with the license and click *Continue*. Download and run *Windows Offline Installation* executable. Proceed through installation steps.

=== Install on Linux ===
Linux users can follow the same installation steps as for Windows, but it is likely to be easier to use a Package Manager of your distribution.

For example, Ubuntu users (particularly 10.04 LTS) should perform the following:
{{{
sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
}}}

Please note, that Eclipse will not work with GCJ. Read [http://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC_FAQ#I_just_installed_Eclipse_on_Linux.2C_but_it_does_not_start._What_is_the_problem.3F more]...

== Plugins installation problems ==
There is a common problem that occurs when Eclipse is installed in a directory with too restrictive permissions (directory is not writeable to the user account; so called "shared installation"), for example, in a `root` only directory (in Linux).

In such case Eclipse reports that a plugin is successfully installed, but it is not loaded during startup and thus is not visible. For example, you might install [InstallToolchainSubversion Subclipse] plugin, but _Checkout Projects from SVN_ entry never appears in _New Project_ wizard.

The only known solution guaranteed to work is to move Eclipse into "your" directory and then reinstall missing plugins.

= Eclipse Tweaks =
Instructions of this section are not necessary to perform.

== User name ==
Open *_<Eclipse root>_\eclipse.ini* and add the following line after *`-vmargs`* line:
{{{
-Duser.name=<You full name>
}}}
Now your full name will be used instead of your login when generating code from templates (for example, when you create a new file).

== Memory ==
If your computer have plenty of RAM you can play with *`-Xms`*, *`-Xmx`* *`and -XX:MaxPermSize`* arguments. But this is not recommended if you do not have a clear understanding of what you are doing.
