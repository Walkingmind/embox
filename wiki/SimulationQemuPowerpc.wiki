We use platform *virtex-ml507* because QEMU has support for it. For running Embox on PowerPC QEMU you have to build Embox with template *ppc/ml507* and start QEMU with option *-M petalogix-s3adsp1800*.

You must have *qemu-system-ppc* simulator or you can configure QEMU as following 
{{{
 ./configure --target-list=ppc-softmmu
 }}}
Full command for start simulation look as:
{{{
qemu-system-ppc -s -S -nographic -M virtex-ml507 -m 256 -net none -kernel <project_path>/build/base/bin/embox
}}}
