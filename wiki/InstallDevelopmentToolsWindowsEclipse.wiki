#summary Eclipse IDE installation HOWTO.

= Introduction =
embox is "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment IDE]-independent" project, so you can edit sources in your favorite editor, compiling them and invoking debugger directly from console. But those who prefer all-in-one solutions will probably look for some kind of integrated development environment.

We recommend you to use *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software) Eclipse IDE]*, especially since embox already contains the necessary project files.

= Brief =
If you have used Eclipse before, you can skip this guide. All you need is *Eclipse IDE* with *CDT* plugin and one of SVN client plugins (*Subversion* or *Subversive*).

The one thing to mention is the use of older versions of Eclipse or CDT (for example, if you already have one installed). CDT is a relatively young project, and therefore it is growing rapidly. So it is desirable to use the version at least not older than one year.

= Step-by-step =
== Download ==
Go to *[http://eclipse.org/downloads]* and select *Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers*.

  Choose the right version accordingly to your Windows.

== Install ==
All you do is unpack the downloaded file in the desired directory. The zip file contains single directory called `eclipse`, with multiple subdirectories under that. So you could unpack the zip file in the root directory (e.g., *`C:\`*) and Eclipse would be installed in *C:\eclipse*.

Run the *eclipse* executable from the installation directory.

== Install JRE ==
This step will likely not be required. But if you get *VM*-related errors when launching Eclipse, then you have to install the latest [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Runtime_Environment JRE].

Go to *[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/]* and click _Download JRE_.

Then select you platform (*Windows* or *Windows x64*), agree with the license and click *Continue*. Download and run *Windows Offline Installation* executable. Proceed through installation steps.

== Eclipse Tweaks ==
Instructions of this section are not necessary to perform.

=== User name ===
Open *_<Eclipse root>_\eclipse.ini* and add the following line after *`-vmargs`* line:
{{{
-Duser.name=<You full name>
}}}
Now your full name will be used instead of your login when generating code from templates (for example, when you create a new file).

=== Memory ===
If your computer have plenty of RAM you can play with *`-Xms`*, *`-Xmx`* *`and -XX:MaxPermSize`* arguments. But this is not recommended if you do not have a clear understanding of what you are doing.
