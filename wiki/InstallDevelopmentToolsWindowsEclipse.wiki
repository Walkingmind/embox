#summary Eclipse IDE installation HOWTO.
#sidebar InstallDevelopmentToolsSideNav

= Introduction =
embox is "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment IDE]-independent" project, so you can edit sources in your favorite editor, compiling them and invoking debugger directly from console. But those who prefer all-in-one solutions will probably look for some kind of integrated development environment.

We recommend you to use *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software) Eclipse IDE]* with *CDT* plugin, especially since embox already contains the necessary project files.

= Brief =
If you have used Eclipse before, you can skip this guide.
