#summary Eclipse IDE installation HOWTO.

= Introduction =
embox is "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment IDE]-independent" project, so you can edit sources in your favorite editor, compiling them and invoking debugger directly from console. But those who prefer all-in-one solutions will probably look for some kind of integrated development environment.

We recommend you to use *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software) Eclipse IDE]*, especially since embox already contains the necessary project files.

= Brief =
If you have used Eclipse before, you can skip this guide. All you need is *Eclipse IDE* with *CDT* plugin and one of SVN client plugins (*Subversion* or *Subversive*).

The one thing to mention is the use of older versions of Eclipse or CDT (for example, if you already have one installed). CDT is a relatively young project, and therefore it is growing rapidly. So it is desirable to use the version at least not older than one year.

= Step-by-step =
== Download ==
Go to *[http://eclipse.org/downloads]* and select *Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers*.

  Choose the right version accordingly to your Windows.

== Install ==
All you do is unpack the downloaded file in the desired directory. The zip file contains single directory called `eclipse`, with multiple subdirectories under that. So you could unpack the zip file in the root directory (e.g., *`C:\`*) and Eclipse would be installed in *C:\eclipse*.
