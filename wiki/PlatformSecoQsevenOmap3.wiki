How to get Embox working on these good:

 * Download secoTools, which is supplied by Seco in private customer sections, no links, sorry.
 * Build embox with arm/omap template
 * Run scripts/omap-uboot-uimage from embox top dir, this will assemble  image suitable for u-boot:
{{{
 ./scripts/omap-uboot-uimage
}}}
 `uImage` file will appear in top dir.
 * Download http://embox.googlecode.com/files/embox.scr and http://embox.googlecode.com/files/seco_qseven_omap3_fs_stub.tar.gz
 * In secoTools there is secoCreateBootDevice.sh, which is run by 
{{{
./secoCreateBootDevice <device> <x-loader> <u-boot> <boot script> <kernel image> <FS_X.tar.gz>
}}} 
You should run
{{{
 ./secoCreateBootDevice <device> x-load-sd_omap-3730.bin.ift u-boot-sd_omap-3730.bin embox.scr /embox/path/uImage seco_qseven_omap3_fs_stub.tar.gz
}}}
{{{<device>}}} here means dev entry of your uSD card, where everything will be placed, e.g. /dev/sdb.

Now you have bootable uSD. Insert it in pITX's card reader and power up the board.
