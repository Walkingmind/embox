= What is Mybuild =

*Mybuild* is build automation and configuration tool oriented on building modular applications.

Mybuild itself is implemented on top of [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ GNU Make] utilizing the power of incremental building of the latter. This also allows one to embed Mybuild into an existing Make-powered build infrastructure. At the same time, despite of using Make, Mybuild uses own [MybuildMyfiles syntax] for describing the build devoid of drawbacks of the language of Makefiles.
