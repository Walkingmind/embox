The file system is an abstraction of a file interface (open, close, read, write, ioctrl) as well as a distribution and data formats in storage devices.

Each file system can create file if permissions allow, and delete it. These operation describe in the appropriate structure.

|| ramfs  || 
|| devfs  ||

= Features =

 # We can use initramfs (cpio, tar formats)
 # We can load ELF files
 # We can use an interface for a device driver that appears in a file system (devfs)

= Roadmap =

= How-To =

To use ramfs image:
 * сreate a separate folder
 * place there necessary files
 * cd into this folder
 * find . -depth -print | cpio -H newc -ov > ../ramfs.cpio
 * fix path in the option(RAMFS_CPIO, "path/ramfs.cpio")
 * mount cpio /ramfs
