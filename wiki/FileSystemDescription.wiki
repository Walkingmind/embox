= Introduction =

The file system is an abstraction of a file interface (open, close, read, write, ioctrl) as well as a distribution and data formats in storage devices.

We can describe root file system as structure of different file systems, and then handle file and folders in these file system through his symbolic name.

Each file system can create file if permissions allow, and delete it. These operation describe in the appropriate structure.

|| rootfs || Rootfs is a node with ramfs driver. Another systems just mount another filesystem over rootfs and ignore it. ||
|| ramfs  || Resizable simple ram filesystem (virtual filesystem) ||
|| devfs  || Device filesystem ||

= Features =

 # We can use initramfs (cpio, tar formats)
 # We can load ELF files
 # We can use an interface for a device driver that appears in a file system (devfs)

= Roadmap =

= How-To =

To use ramfs image:
 * сreate a separate folder
 * place there necessary files
 * cd into this folder
 * find . -depth -print | cpio -H newc -ov > ../ramfs.cpio
 * fix path in the option(RAMFS_CPIO, "path/ramfs.cpio")
 * mount cpio /ramfs
