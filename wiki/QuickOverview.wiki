= Five facts about Embox =
 == Embox is modular and configurable ==
  Instead of using monolithic architecture, Embox is organized into a set of fine-grained modules, each of which can implement some interface. Typical example is a scheduling strategy or a memory allocation algorithm. Therefore the final image of Embox can be finely tuned for a specific usage.

 == Embox is cross-platform ==
  Currently Embox is ported on four processor architectures: x86, SPARC v8, ARM7 and Microblaze. The complete list of supported platform can be found [PlatformsDescription here]. Porting Embox to a new platform is relatively simple: all you need is to implement a well-defined [Hal HAL] interface.

 == Embox is a testing framework ==
  Embox includes an embedded unit testing framework which can be used for developing, debugging and self-checking both hardware and software modules of the system.

 == Embox helps to design a new hardware ==
  As a highly configurable system, Embox can run in a very constrained environment such as hardware simulators. Thus it can be used at early stages of hardware development. At the design phase you can estimate required hardware resources and during the debugging you prepare a set of tests with the required coverage.

 == Embox simplifies certification process ==
  A build system used in Embox allows you to get a source distribution with only required modules included. It reduces the total amount of code needed for certification making that process more cheaper. In addition the build system allows to get full files list and modules graph. 
 
= Goals of the project =

*Embox* is used in embedded system, including network systems

*Embox* is used in robots. The project was ported to the [http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx lego-mindstorms] platform.

*Embox* is used for teaching students for practice in the programming and design of embedded system, robotics, architecture of operating system, telecommunication system. It's also used in the research in pointed directions.  

*Embox* is used just for fun. We like kernel hacking.
