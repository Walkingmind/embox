#summary Building USB live flash

= Details =
 * Choose flash drive. Let it be, for example, `/dev/sdb`
 * Build embox with some of x86 tempaltes

== grub ==
Staying in embox root dir, run `./scripts/live-flash` with arguments of bootloader and flash. Bootloader could be `grub` or `syslinux`. As more common, consider `grub` at first. Example:
{{{
# ./scripts/live-flash grub /dev/sdb
}}}
This script automatically installs grub and embox on specified flash. When it done, the flash is ready for boot.

== syslinux == 
Syslinux a bit more complicated. At first, you need special version of syslinux, where multiboot module correctly handles video mode parameter.
Download [https://embox.googlecode.com/files/syslinux.tar.gz] and extract it to `scripts/syslinux` so that full path to `extlinux` be like `scripts/syslinux/sbin/extlinux`

Then, assuming usb is on `/dev/sdb` type
{{{
# ./scripts/live-flash syslinux /dev/sdb
}}}

When it done, flash is prepared.
