#summary Building USB live flash

= Details =

 * Choose flash drive. Let it be, for example, `/dev/sdb`
 * Build embox with some of x86 tempaltes
 * Staying in embox root dir, run `./scripts/live-flash` with arguments of bootloader and flash. Bootloader could be `grub` or `syslinux`. As more common, consider `grub` at first. Example:
{{{
# ./scripts/live-flash grub /dev/sdb
}}}
This script automatically installs grub and embox on specified flash. When it done, the flash is ready for boot.
