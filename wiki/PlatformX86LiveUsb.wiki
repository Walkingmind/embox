#summary Building USB live flash

= Details =

 * Build embox with some of x86 tempaltes
 * Partition usb flash with one partition, format it to ext2. Probably, other configurations will work, but I end up with this.
 * Perform grub-install
{{{
 # grub-install --root-directory=/media/flash /dev/sdb
}}} 
 where /dev/sdb is you usb device, and /media/flash is where /dev/sdb1 (your only and ext2 partition) is mounted.
 * Place /embox/path/build/base/bin/embox in /media/flash/boot/
 * Create grub menu entry, described [GettingStartedX86#GRUB_loader here]
