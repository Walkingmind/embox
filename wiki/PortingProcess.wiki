= Introduction =
Embox is a multi-platform operationg system, it means this project was ported to several types of processor’s architecture including some open platform: [http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC SPARC], [http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroBlaze micriblaze], and so on. These architectures often are used in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System-on-a-chip System-on-chip (SOC)]. You can learn more details about supported architecture on [ProjetDescription the project description page] in the section *supported architectures*.

Most of project’s code was written in C languages and independent on cpu’s platform. There are some architecture specific code it places in folder named *arch*. This folder contains HAL interface implementation, constant and macroses for the architecture, base linker script for this architecture.

This page contains minimal requirements for execution code on a new architecture.

= List of architecture dependent part =
 * [#Headers Headers]
 * [#Boot_code Boot code]
 * [#Linker_scripts Linker scripts]

First of all [#Default_IO Default IO]
Then:
 * [#Interrupt_handlers Interrupt handlers]
 * [#System_timer System timer]
 * [#Trap_handlers  Traps handlers]
