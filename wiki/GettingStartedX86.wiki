You can execute Embox on the x86 platform with Simulator and also you can do this on real hardware platform. There are 2 hardware platform: 
 * biffboard for embedded system 
 * usual PC with BIOS and grub loader
 
== grub loader ==
if you PC using grub as loader you should modify /boot/grub/menu.lst for starting Embox


If you PC using grub2 as loader add follow text to the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg
{{{
### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/<number>_embox ###
EMBOX
menuentry "Embox" {

  multiboot (hd0,6)/<project_path>/build/base/bin/embox
  boot
}
### END /etc/grub.d/<number>_embox ###
}}}
