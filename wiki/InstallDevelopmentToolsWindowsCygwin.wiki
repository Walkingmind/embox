#summary Cygwin installation HOWTO.
#sidebar InstallDevelopmentToolsSideNav

= Introduction =
As far as embox uses GNU toolchain, you'll need to setup a Unix-like environment on you Windows machine.
We recommend you to use *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin Cygwin]* for that purpose.

= Brief =
If you are familiar with Cygwin installation procedure, you can skip the most of this guide. You should install the following packages:
 * *make* 3.81 or above
 * *gcc* or *gcc4* of any stable version
Do not forget to add Cygwin's *`bin`* directory to your *PATH*. 

= Step-by-step =
== Download ==
Go to *[http://cygwin.com]* and download Cygwin setup executable.

  Click on _Install or update Cygwin now!_
----

== Setup Cygwin ==
Run the setup executable and proceed through installation steps.

=== Installation type ===
Keep the default value:
 * *Install from Internet*

=== Installation directory ===
When prompted, choose the Cygwin installation directory. The default is *`C:\cygwin`*, but you can change it. Leave *Install for* as default:
 * *All Users*
*Note* that the directory path *must not* contain any spaces or non-latin characters.

----

=== Local Package directory ===
Cygwin will download its installation files to the specified directory. The default is directory which was used to save the setup executable. You may leave the default value.  

=== Connection type ===
Setup your Internet connection which will be used to download installation files. The right choice depends on your ISP and network settings.

=== Download sites ===
Choose any available mirror.

=== Select Packages ===
Default Cygwin installation includes only minimal subset of all available packages.

We also need GNU *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software) make]* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation build automation] tool and *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection gcc]* for the host platform.

==== make ====
Select package *make*, version *3.81* or higher.
 http://embox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/cygwin-setup-make.png
  Type `make` into search field and select _make_ from category _Devel_.
----
==== gcc ====
You are free to choose between *gcc* and *gcc4* packages of any stable version.
 http://embox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/cygwin-setup-gcc4.png
  Search for `gcc` and select _gcc_ or _gcc4_ from category _Devel_.
----

=== Finish the Installation ===
You'll be notified about the packages to be installed and prompted whether to create desktop icons after the installation is complete.

== Setup the PATH ==
To invoke Cygwin applications outside Cygwin Bash Console (e.g. from [InstallDevelopmentToolsWindowsEclipse Eclipse]) you should also add *_[#Installation_directory <Cygwin root>]_\bin* to the *PATH* environment variable.

 * Proceed through *System properties → Advanced → Environment Variables*
 * Press *New...* inside *User variables* pane
 * Type `PATH` inside the first field and `%PATH%;C:\cygwin\bin` inside the second one (depending on where you have [#Installation_directory installed Cygwin])
