#summary Installing Mybuild plugin for Eclipse IDE HOWTO.

= Introduction =

Embox uses [Mybuild] for build automation and configuration management. Mybuild uses special text files (so-called my-files), that describe modules to build.

In order to get IDE support of Mybuild (syntax highlighting of my-files, code completion, refactorings and so on), you have to install *Mybuild plugin for Eclipse*.

= Brief =

If you're familiar with Eclipse plugin installation process, then all you need is an address of the update site with latest version of Mybuild plugin:

 <b>[http://embox.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/eclipse-plugin/update-site/]</b>

The feature to install is called *Mybuild*.

= Step-by-step =

== Open Install New Software dialog ==

From Eclipse main menu open *Help â†’ Install New Software...*

== Select Update Site ==

Enter the address of our update site into _Work with_ field:
 <b>[http://embox.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/eclipse-plugin/update-site/]</b>.
After loading of the site contents, check *Mybuild* item.

== Confirm Selected Features ==

By default you'll see all features included. No need to change them, so go *Next >*.

== Finish the Installation ==

You will have to _accept the terms of license agreements_ to be able to proceed.

*Note:* During the installation you will get _Security Warning_ message, which
notifies about installing a software from uncertified sources. This is a normal
case, so just continue the installation.

After the Software will be installed you will be prompted to restart Eclipse for
the changes to take effect.
