We use platform *petalogix-s3adsp1800* because QEMU has support for it. For running Embox on microblaze QEMU you have to build Embox with template *microblaze/petalogic* and start QEMU with option *-M petalogix-s3adsp1800*.

You must have qemu-system-microblaze simulator or you can configure QEMU as following 
{{{
 ./configure --target-list=microblaze-linux-user,microblaze-softmmu
 }}}
Full command for start simulation look as:
{{{
qemu-system-microblaze -s -S -nographic -M petalogix-s3adsp1800 -net none -kernel <project_path>/build/base/bin/embox
}}}
