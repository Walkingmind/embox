= Linux =

 # [http://code.google.com/p/libnxt/downloads/detail?name=libnxt-0.3.tar.gz&can=2&q= Get] and compiling libnxt
{{{
$ cd <dir_libnxt-0.3>
$ scons
}}}
OR get [http://embox.googlecode.com/files/libnxt-0.3_prebuilt.tar.gz prebuilt binaries]. 
 # Configure Embox with 'arm' platform 'nxt' template
 # Put NXT brick into flashing mode. This can be done via power_mng nxt platform test or via long (6s) pressing of reset button. In flashing mode brick clicks every ~1 sec.
 # Flashing Embox
{{{
# fwflash embox.bin
}}}

=== Troubleshooting ===

 * You must have write access for usb device! (Notice fwflash running with root priveleges)
 * Even with root you probably cannot flash nxt. Check if existing Linux driver gets device (e.g. cdc_acm for me)
{{{
# modprobe -r cdc_acm
# modprobe -r sam_be
}}}
This will remove linux modules, confilicting with `fwflash`. Some modules may not be presented in your system, so errors on running commands above are normal

= Windows =
 # [http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/utilities.html Getting] and installing NeXTTool
 # Configure Embox with 'arm' platform 'nxt' template
 # Put NXT brick into flashing mode. This can be done via power_mng nxt platform test or via long (6s) pressing of reset button. In flashing mode brick clicks every ~1 sec.
 # Flashing Embox from NeXTTool directory
{{{
# nexttool -firmware=<path>/embox.bin
}}}

=== Troubleshooting ===
 * Windows 7 by default recognizes Lego Mindstorms NXT Brick as GPS Camera. Uninstall GPS Camera's driver from system and install drivers from Lego's software CD.
