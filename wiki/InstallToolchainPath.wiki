#summary HOWTO Set up PATH environment variable in your system.

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Introduction =

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(variable) PATH]* environment variable specifies a list of directories where executable programs are located. Each time you type the command without its full path, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing) shell] searches every directory listed in the `PATH` variable from the beginning and invokes the first found executable.

= Windows =
Some things to denote first:
 * `PATH` variable on Windows uses _semicolon_ (*`;`*) to separate directories in the list
 * Variables can refer to another one using _percent_ signs: *`%VARIABLE_NAME%`*
 * Environment variables on Windows are case insensitive

To manage *Environment Variables* open the corresponding properties dialog:
 # Right click *My Computer* icon and select *Properties*
  * Users of Windows Vista or higher should also click on *Advanced system settings* link on the left side of the opened window
 # Open *Advanced* tab and press *Environment Variables*

You have two options here - you can either modify system-wide `PATH` variable or create user variable which takes precedence over the system one.

== Per-user setup ==
Using this option affects only the current user account. This is useful for users with limited administrative rights.

To create new user variable:
 * Press _New..._ inside _User variables_ pane
 * Type `PATH` inside the first field and the desired value inside the second one

Do not forget to keep the default system paths in the overridden `PATH` variable.

== System-wide setup ==
Use this option if you want your changes to take effect for all users on your computer. Be careful and do not remove any directories from `PATH` unless you clearly understand what you are doing.

To modify `PATH` system variable select it in _System variables_ pane and double-click it or press _Edit..._.

== Example ==
The most common reason to modify `PATH` variable is the need to append some directory to it.

Consider the case of adding Cigwin executables directory to the `PATH`. Let Cigwin is installed to `C:\cygwin`, and we don't want to modify system paths (or we don't have such permissions).
Thus we create new user variable (or modify existing one, if any) and name it `PATH`. As far as we don't need to completely override system paths, the desired value of the new variable is:
{{{
%PATH%;C:\cygwin\bin
}}}

= Linux =
Some important rules concerning environment variables in Linux (and Unix in general):
 * `PATH` variable uses _colon_ (*`:`*) delimiter
 * Variables can refer to another one using _dollar_ sign: *`$VARIABLE_NAME`*
 * Environment variables are local to process, and child processes inherit all the environment variables of parent process
 * Case sensitivity

It is assumed that you are experienced enough to learn how to set environment variables in your shell.

For `bash` you typically have to edit *`~/.profile`* or *`~/.bash_profile`* adding something like:
{{{
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/your/bin"
}}}
