#summary HOWTO Set up PATH environment variable in your system.

= Introduction =

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(variable) PATH]* environment variable specifies a list of directories where executable programs are located. Each time you type the command without its full path, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing) shell] searches every directory listed in the `PATH` variable from the beginning and invokes the first found executable.

= Windows =
Open *Environment Variables* properties:
 # Right click *My Computer* icon and select *Properties*
  * Users of Windows Vista or higher should also click on *Advanced system settings* link on the left side of the opened window
 # Open *Advanced* tab and press *Environment Variables*

You have two options here - you can either modify system-wide `PATH` variable or create user variable which takes precedence over system one.

== Per-user setup ==
Using this option affects only the current user account. This is useful for users with limited administrative rights.

To create new user variable:
 * Press _New..._ inside _User variables_ pane
 * Type `PATH` inside the first field and the desired value inside the second one

You can refer to any other variable using _percent_ sign: *`%VARIABLE_NAME%`*. For example, it is often useful to pick the value of system `PATH` being overridden.

== System-wide setup ==
Use this option if you want your changes to take effect for all users on your computer. Be careful and do not remove any directories from `PATH` unless you clearly understand what you are doing.

To modify `PATH` system variable select it in _System variables_ pane and double-click it or press _Edit..._.

== Example ==
The most common reason to modify `PATH` variable is the need to append some directory to it.
