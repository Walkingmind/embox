The board has integrated debugger that allows to program it with single USB-A-USB-mini-B wire.

We are using free (as a speech) software to communicate with the debugger: https://github.com/texane/stlink, that provides gdb server. It is a single choice on Linux systems, on Windows, practically, you may prefer manufacturer's own software.

To try Embox on the board, you should configure and compile with *arm/stm32_vl* template.

Further, setup stlink (you may adjust rights for device, set up symlinks, etc. All required steps are on stlink's repo page) and run st-util from it's package.

And finally, load Embox with usual gdb commands 
{{{
target extended-remote :4242
load
c
}}}

Notice, that commands above use st-util's default gdb port that you might change.
