#summary Running Embox on QEMU SPARC simulator

This page is about simulating Embox on QEMU SPARC. It is assumed that you're familiar with general notes about [SimulationQemu using QEMU].

= Installing QEMU =
To be able to use QEMU for simulating SPARC CPUs, you have to get `qemu-system-sparc`. Usually it is available through the package manager of your OS under the names `qemu-system` or `qemu-kvm-extras`:
{{{
sudo apt-get install qemu-system
}}}

Another option is to configure and build it manually:
{{{
./configure â€“target-list=sparc-softmmu
make
sudo make install
}}}

= Running QEMU =
To simulate Embox on QEMU for LEON3 processor run `qemu-system-sparc` passing these additional options:
{{{
-M leon3_generic -cpu LEON3
}}}
For example:
{{{
qemu-system-sparc -nographic -M leon3_generic -cpu LEON3 -kernel path/to/embox
}}}
