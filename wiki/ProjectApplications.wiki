= Commercial =

Embox originates from a commercial project of [http://lanit-tercom.com Lanit-Tercom, Inc.]. *TODO*

== Hardware development ==

Helps in hardware testing at very early stages of development.

== Product certification ==

As far as the complete source tree is hardly ever used for the final release, there are special tools provided for those who need to pass the code certification. A fine-grained modular structure allows you to extract only those sources which are used in the final build.

= Educational =

The core development team consists of students and graduates of [http://www.math.spbu.ru/en/index.html Saint-Petersburg State University]. *TODO*

== Student projects ==
[http://www.math.spbu.ru/en/chairs/dep21.html Theoretical Cybernetics department] intrested in the project results. As a result of the partnership between departments was robotics OS.
Now the project works on [PlatformLegoNxt Lego Mindstorms NXT] and has some commercial advantage.

== Coursework ==

= Just for fun =
Enjoy the kernel hacking!
