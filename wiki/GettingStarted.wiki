#summary How to get envolved to Embox

= Introduction =

To run Embox You must compile it first. You need simple development environment.
If You're on Linux, docs lies [here] and skip next section to [compiling].

Follows running with [cygwin] on Windows(r).

= Cygwin =

Install [cygwin]. During normal installation you'll be asked for additional pacakages. Necessary packages are: make, gcc. It's recommended to use [our] build of gcc as one known to work. So, check make (gcc is optionally, if you haven't preffer our build). 

Read more in detail [here].

= Compiling Embox =

So, You've installed build environment, now it's time to make you first Embox build. As Embox is highly configureable, i.e. consits of a set of modules which are configured with options, compiling is not just typing "make" on console, first You need describe configuration. Embox is bundled with a set of common config templates for various architectures and purposes. Configuring is much more easy by modifying from some start point.

Go for embox root dir (i.e. which consists of conf/, src/, ...)

$ cd embox

You can copy template to freely modify config by

$ make config PROJECT=arch PROFILE=purpose

or

$ make menuconfig

This will copy templates/arch/purpose/ content to conf/. As You see, templates a stored in templates/ with appropriate subdirs. Only content of templates/ defines avaible templates.

For example, if You want play with Embox just as on real machine, configure with 
arch=x86 and purpose=debug (this means a large subset of options and modules on), e.g.:

$ make config PROJECT=x86 PROFILE=debug

Next, you can optionally change config as described [here]

At now You can build Embox just typing 

$ make

It's smart build-system resolves all dependecies and automatically includes those to image.

Now, You have Embox image ready to run.
