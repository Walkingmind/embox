#summary Describes project Embox's usage on platform Lego Mindstorms NXT Atmel AT91SAM7S256 ARM7TDMI

= Description =

Project Embox has been ported on platform [http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx lego-mindstorms].
We use this platform to show possibilities of Embox to manage realtime systems
which include limited hardware resources.
Platform [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEGO_Mindstorms Lego Mindstorms] can work
with two types of controllers: RCX and NXT. LEGO Mindstorms NXT is a computational
module based on Atmel AT91SAM7S256 ARM7TDMI microcontroller and attached to it
AVR controller via I2C interface. AVR is used to collect data from most of the
sensors and control motors. Explanations and the technical specifications below.

= Development =

The code for the platform part of the Lego Nxt is located in the folder /platform/lego_nxt/.
It contains code driver, description, interfaces, and usage examples.

To develop under this platform, you must install the environment:
 * cross-compiler ARM gcc
 * Eclipse (CDT)
 * Cygwin or MinGW (for Windows users)

== Drivers ==
Embox supports the following devices that are part of Lego Mindstorms.
 * motor
 * touch sensor
 * sonar
 * light sensor

== API [under construction] ==
You can use these functions to work with Lego.
