 * @brief An safe implementation of 'dlist' interface. It protects the list
 *      from re-add and re-delete an item.
 *
 * @details This implementation of 'dlist' interface uses special value for
 *       examine re-add and re-delete operation. This value is list_id. It is
 *       the list head address. Each item head in the list must contains
 *       similar list_id. If adding item head has set not NULL list_id field it
 *       means that this item head already in a list and the assertion will
 *       call.
