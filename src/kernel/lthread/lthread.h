/**
 * @file
 * @brief Describes light thread structure
 *
 * A light thread is an atomic stackless thread that usually has a high
 * priority. Light threads are very similar to coroutines and have an
 * interface to manage its multiple entry points (see #lthread_resume() and
 * #lthread_yield() functions).
 *
 * Light threads don't have an execution context as opposite to ordinary
 * threads. Nonetheless it is allowed to use waitq and sched_wait functions
 * and share synchronization primitives with regular threads. Of course the
 * absence of the own stack imposes some restrictions, thus one must use the
 * light thread API with care.
 *
 * @note
 * All non-static local variables become invalid when lthread is returned
 * from its run function.
 *
 * Examine the example:
 *
 * @code
 *  static int example(struct lthread *self) {
 *      // Each time lthread runs it is executed from the beginning of its run
 *      // function. If it is necessary to start from another place, use the
 *      // following pattern.
 *      goto lthread_resume(self, &&start);
 *
 *   start:
 *        // If example() runs for the first time, goto jumps here.
 *        ...
 *
 *   mutex_retry:
 *       if (mutex_trylock_lthread(self, &mutex) == -EAGAIN) {
 *           // mutex is held by another schedee, exit from function in order
 *           // to be woken up later. The next time execution will start with
 *           // goto mutex_retry.
 *           return lthread_yield(&&start, &&mutex_retry);
 *       }
 *
 *       ... // executes with mutex held
 *
 *       mutex_unlock_lthread(self, &mutex);
 *
 *       ...
 *
 *       // Return value 0 corresponds to the start label.
 *       return 0;
 *  }
 * @endcode
