		NAME
			umount - unmount file systems
		SYNOPSIS
			umount [-h]  dir ...
		DESCRIPTION
			The  umount command detaches the file system(s) mentioned from the file
			hierarchy.  A file system is specified by giving the directory where it
			has  been  mounted.  Giving the special device on which the file system
			lives may also work, but is obsolete, mainly because it  will  fail  in 
			case this device was mounted on more than one directory.
