# Usage: $(call r-wildcard,pattern...)
#
# Note: does not handle properly more than one ** tokens in single pattern.

# Recursively performs wildcard expansion of double asrerisk for *, */*, ...
#
# Some examples:
#  (good) foo/*/bar
#      -> (single word after replacement, use simple wildcard)
#  (good) foo/**/bar
#      -> foo/* */bar
#      -> foo/, *, /bar

#  (bad)  foo/**/bar/**
#      -> foo/* */bar/* *
#      -> (3 words, fail with an error)
