Embox - Essential toolbox for embedded development.

Embox is a configurable operating system. Instead of providing a monolithic kernel, 
all code are placed in libraries which realize different interfaces for example memory 
manager interface. Only required parts of the system are included into final image. 
The required parts are defined during configuration of system or in run time.
