		NAME
			pnet - Util for PNET configuration
			
		SYNOPSIS
			pnet -a --graph graph
			pnet -a --node graph node1...nodeN
			pnet -a --rule graph node
			pnet -d graph node
			pnet -p graph root
			pnet -p [--nodes] graph
			pnet -p --rules graph node
			pnet -n
			pnet {-r|-s} graph
			pnet -l graph node1 node2
			pnet -t graph node rule [RULE_OPTIONS] <value>
			
		DESCRIPTION
			-a	
				Create new graph, new node in graph or new rule in node in graph. Specify 
				by GRAPH_OPTIONS what you want to create. 
			
			-d 
				Marks node that it is not in any graph and deletes it from graph repository (list
				of nodes that were be added in graph).  
				NOTE: each node, that had link (rx_dfault) to deleted node still will be have 
				this link notwithstanding deleted node already is'nt in any graph. So, rebuild
				your graph at once after completion of node delete.
				
			-p	
				Display chain of nodes start with 'root'.
				If --nodes option is specified then display graph repository.
				If --rules option is specified then display all rules from matcher.
				
			-n
				Display all PNET nodes and protocols in system.
				
			-r
				Start graph
				
			-s
				Stop graph
				
			-l
				Link node2 to node1 in graph. Node2 must be contained in graph repository already.
			
			-t
				Set to rule some RULE_OPTIONS
			
		OPTIONS
			GRAPH_OPTIONS:
			--graph
				specify graph
				
			--node 
				specify node
				
			--rule
				specify rule
			
			RULE_OPTIONS:
				--ip <value>
					Set IP address to destination host.
					
				--mac <value>
					Set hardware address to destination host.
					
				--node <value>
					Set next node. It means that if received pack correspond to 
					rule, than next handler of pack will be node set by this option.
				
				--rename <value>
					Set rule identifier <value>. Thereafter you can refer to rule by this identifier.
					Notes: All rules have identifier 0 by default.
					If you get rule by it's identifier, this rule is the first rule in list of rules
					in specified node.
