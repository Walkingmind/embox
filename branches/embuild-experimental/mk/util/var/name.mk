ifndef __util_var_name_mk
__util_var_name_mk := 1

##
# Usage example:
#
##
#  include util/var/name.mk
#
#  # First, define two variables (one of them has whitespaces in its name):
#     a_regular_single_word_named_variable = foo
#     a one with whitespaces   in its name = bar
#
#  # A list containing their names looks like this:
#  variables_list = \
#     a_regular_single_word_named_variable \
#     a one with whitespaces   in its name
#
#  # Make sees 8 whitespace separated words in variables_list:
#  $(info variables_list has $(words $(variables_list)) words in it)
#
#  # Mangle the list!
#  mangled_variables_list := \
#     $(call var_name_mangle,$(variables_list) and some undefined garbage)
#
#  # The mangled list contains only 2 words:
#  $(info mangled_variables_list contains only \
#          $(words $(mangled_variables_list)) words)
#
#  # ... and we can safely iterate over them
#  #     demangling each element to restore the initial value:
#  $(foreach var,$(mangled_variables_list), \
#      $(info var name found: \
#                    [$(call var_name_demangle,$(var))]) \
#   )
#
#  # The output of the code above will be:
#  # variables_list has 8 words in it
#  # mangled_variables_list contains only 2 words
#  # var name found: [a_regular_single_word_named_variable]
#  # var name found: [and   with whitespaces   in its name]
#

##
# Function: var_name_mangle
# Escapes variables list in a special way so that it becomes possible to
# iterate over it using 'foreach', even if some variables contain whitespaces
# in their names.
# The name of each variable as is can be restored back using
# 'var_name_demangle' function.
#
# Params:
#  1. (optional) Variables list.
#     If not specified, the value of .VARIABLES built-in variable is used
# Return: whitespace separated list, each element of which is mangled name of
#          a defined variable from the specified list (or from $(.VARIABLES))
