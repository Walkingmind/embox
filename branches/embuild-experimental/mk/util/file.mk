# Recursively performs wildcard expansion of double asrerisk for *, */*, ...

# Some examples:
#  (good) foo/*/bar
#      -> (single word after replacement, use simple wildcard)
#  (good) foo/**/bar
#      -> foo/* */bar
#      -> foo/, *, /bar
#      -> foo/, */*, /bar
#      -> ... (expand wildcards while foo/*/*/.../ gives non-empty result)
#  (bad)  foo/**/bar/**
#      -> foo/* */bar/* *
#      -> (3 words, fail with an error)

# Directory/file versions of wildcard.
# Both of them are based on the fact that wildcard expansion of the expression
# containing the trailing slash drops the slash for files but leaves it for
# directories.

# Directory-only wildcard. This version of wildcard filters out any files
# leaving only directories.

# Usage: $(call d-wildcard,pattern...)

# expansion result.

#   Expand d-wildcards for sub-dirs within the base dir.
#   Get back to sub-dirs relative names and remove duplicates.
