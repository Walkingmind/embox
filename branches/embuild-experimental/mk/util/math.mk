# plus        Called with integer arguments and returns an integer
# int_plus    Called with encoded arguments and returns an encoded result
#
# plus will be slower than int_plus because its arguments and result
# have to be translated between the x's format and integers.  If doing
# a complex calculation use the int_* forms with a single encoding of
# inputs and single decoding of the output.  For simple calculations
# the direct forms can be used.

# takes a pair of integers, perhaps a function and returns an integer
