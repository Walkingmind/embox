# secondly it prevents a warning about SHELL referencing itself with

# called to see if the breakpoint should be hit (which will happen
# when SHELL is called again with an argument of __BREAKPOINT).  So
# setting the __BP_FLAG prevents the breakpoint from being checked
# more than once per target and only __BP_CHECK will set $1 and hence
