NAME
     xattr -- display and manipulate extended attributes

SYNOPSIS
     xattr [-lrsvx] file ...
     xattr -p [-lrsvx] attr_name file ...
     xattr -w [-rsx] attr_name attr_value file ...
     xattr -d [-rsv] attr_name file ...
     xattr -c [-rsv] file ...
     xattr -h | --help

DESCRIPTION
     The xattr command can be used to display, modify or remove the extended 
     attributes of one or more files, including directories and symbolic links.
     Extended attributes are arbitrary metadata stored with a file, but 
     separate from the filesystem attributes (such as modification time or file
     size). The metadata is often a null-terminated UTF-8 string, but can also 
     be arbitrary binary data.

     One or more files may be specified on the command line.  For the first two
     forms of the command, when there are more than one file, the file name is
     displayed along with the actual results.  When only one file is specified,
     the display of the file name is usually suppressed (unless the -v option 
     described below, is also specified).

     In the first form of the command (without any other mode option specified),
     the names of all extended attributes are listed.  
     Attribute names can also be displayed using ``ls -l@''.

     In the second form, using the -p option (``print''), the value associated 
     with the given attribute name is displayed.  Attribute values are usually
     displayed as strings.  However, if nils are detected in the
     data, the value is displayed in a hexadecimal representation.

     The third form, with the -w option (``write''), causes the given attribute
     name to be assigned the given value.

     The fourth form, with the -d option (``delete''), causes the given 
     attribute name (and associated value), to be removed.

     In the fifth form, with the -c option (``clear''), causes all attributes 
     (including their associated values), to be removed.

     Finally, the last form, with either the -h or --help option, displays a 
     short help message and exits immediately.

OPTIONS
     -l  By default, the first two command forms either displays just the 
         attribute names or values, respectively.
         The -l option causes both the attribute names and corresponding values
         to be displayed. For hexadecimal display of values, the output is 
         preceeded with the hexadecimal offset values and followed by ASCII 
         display, enclosed by ``|''.

     -x  Force the attribute value to be displayed in the hexadecimal 
         representation.

         The -w option normally assumes the input attribute value is a string.  
         Specifying the -x option causes xattr to expect the input in 
         hexadecimal (whitespace is ignored).  The xxd(1) command can be used
         to create hexadecimal representations from existing binary data, to 
         pass to xattr.
