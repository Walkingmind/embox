<b>We have migrated <a href='https://github.com/embox/embox'>the repository</a> and <a href='https://github.com/embox/embox/issues'>the issue tracker</a> to GitHub.</b>

# Who we are #
The project has been started by few employees of [Hardware Engineering Department](http://hardware.tercom.ru/eng/) of [Lanit-Tercom, Inc.](http://lanit-tercom.com) as a part of commercial project in 2009, and soon it was decided to share the code with others. Now the development team consists primarily of students of [Saint-Petersburg State University](http://www.math.spbu.ru/en/index.html) as well as of founders of the project.
